# why magic?

### @magic is tiny

usually, all the javascript in your homepage will be 30-60 kb big (after unpacking),
10-30 kb get transmitted from the server to the client.

this complete page you are reading with all sub pages loads about 40kb of unpacked,
15kb of gzipped javascript.

### @magic works without javascript

most of the functionality works without javascript,
some buttons and realtime user interactions obviously won't,
but @magic always provides a non-javascript fallback that gets enhanced by js if possible.

### @magic generates static pages

this makes free hosting (using github or gitlab pages) possible.
and it's easy to
[get started](/getting-started/).

## free hosting

@magic publishes to
[github](https://github.com)
[gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com)
and any other git-pages enabled hosting service.

### serverless / faas

automagically generate
serverless lambdas, derived from the
[@magic-modules](https://github.com/magic-modules/)
you use in your pages.

this makes contact forms, visitor statistics, user authentication and authorization,
chat, and all other server side services possible.
