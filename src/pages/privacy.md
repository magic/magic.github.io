# privacy policy

## Do's

### encourage anonymity
most of our services will include measures that prevent us from knowing your ip address.

since the threat vector in those cases are we,
@magic, it usually is sufficient to relay all requests through anonymizer networks.

for a chance at actual anonymity,
usage of tools like tor is encouraged,
and our networks will not block requests from those networks.

## Dont's


we will never, under no circumstances, share information about our users with **any** third parties.

### canary:
as long as [this canary link works](/canary/),
we have not shared any data about our users with anyone.

### local data

personal data we access on your machine and do not send anywhere, ever:

1. your git config user.email (never uploaded)
2. your public gpg key associated with that email.
3. your gpg keys published on github or gitlab.

thats it.
