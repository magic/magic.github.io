# about @magic

magic is a module based generator for interactive clients, apis and static pages.

this is also called a [jamstack](https://jamstack.org/), javascript, apis and markup.

less than 15kb of html + css + javascript boilerplate means @magic is minimal,
and the module based approach means that it is also easily extendable and customizable.

## philosophy

### simplicity

@magic makes it easy to stitch any kind of webapp together.

by providing simple, well documented, and self contained modules,
@magic enables you to create complex interfaces with minimal cognitive overhead.

### audience

@magic will work in any team that has one or more developers / content creators / editors.

it is intended for organizational structures focused around small teams
working in [programmer anarchy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIxHmsWCd7g),
where every person and every team is responsible for their own slice of the pie,
with minimal oversight and organizational overhead.

some call it agile.

### workflow

the developers create custom components,
which the content creators use to create the actual content of the pages,
written in markdown.

once the content has been created,
the developer (or editor) creates a new bundle and pushes the changes to the page.

this allows every team member to spend time with the things they are good at,
mapping individual respons**A**bilities to a natural hierarchy of competency.

### jsomorphic

by creating html, css and javascript files,
@magic makes sure that your pages load as quickly as possible,
and a well designed app will stay usable without javascript.

if javascript is enabled,
the client will automagically enhance itself with javascript only functionality.

### minimal dependencies

@magic has one external production dependency (spanning about 500 lines of code),
[jorge bucaran](https://github.com/jorgebucaran)'s excellent
[hyperapp](https://hyperapp.dev) library,
which provides the foundational state machine that @magic is built upon.

### privacy
